* Checklist
** Two main objectives
*** DONE She is interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:23]
*** DONE She is also interested in learning something new about movies
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:23]
** Your project will consist of 6 parts:
*Make sure these points are addressed!*
As part of this project you will complete exploratory data analysis
(EDA), modeling, and prediction.

All template and rubric files that you will need to complete this
project can be found on the Project Files and Rubric page.
*** Data: (3 points)
**** DONE Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
**** DONE the implications of this data collection method on the scope
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
of inference (generalizability / causality).
*** Research question: (3 points)
**** DONE Come up with a research question
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
that you want to answer using these data and a multiple linear
regression model.
**** DONE You should phrase your research question
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset
allows for.
**** DONE You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones.
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
**** DONE Along with your research question include a brief discussion
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
(1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or
your audience.
*** EDA: (10 points)
**** DONE Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
the research question you outlined above.
**** DONE Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations.
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
**** DONE Your EDA does not have to touch on every single variable that
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:24]
you are considering for your model, but what you choose to present
should be a deliberate (not haphazard) selection. This might mean you
initially create a lot more visualizations and summary statistics than
what you finally choose to include in your paper.
**** DONE Each R output and plot should be accompanied
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:05]
by a brief interpretation.
*** Modeling: (20 points)
**** DONE Develop a multiple linear regression model
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
to predict a numerical variable in the dataset.
**** DONE The response variable and the explanatory variables
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
can be existing variables in the dataset, or new variables you create
based on existing variables.
*** Prediction: (5 points)
**** DONE Pick a movie from 2016 (a new movie that is not in the sample)
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
and
***** DONE do a prediction for this movie using your the model
	  CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
you developed and
***** DONE the `predict` function in R.
	  CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
***** DONE Also quantify the uncertainty around this prediction
	  CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
using an appropriate interval.
*** Conclusion: (3 points)
**** DONE A brief summary of your findings from the previous sections without
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
repeating your statements from earlier
**** DONE as well as a discussion of what you have learned about the data
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
and your research question.
**** DONE You should also discuss any shortcomings of your current study
	 CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:06]
(either due to data collection or methodology) and include ideas for
possible future research.

** In addition to these parts, there are also 6 points allocated to:
- format
- overall organization
- readability of your project

Total points add up to 50 points. See the assessment rubric on the
Project Files and Rubric page for more details on how your peers will
evaluate your work.
* Notes on the data
** We are given the release day, month, and year
Can we correlate to holiday weekends? That would require finding and
adding more data.
** I can see a few Y's here
- Oscar nominations (there are a few categories)
- critics_rating
- imdb_rating
- audience_rating
- audience_score

to name a few.
** TODO Maybe look at the distributions of the different ratings
How skewed are the different ratings systems?
*** audience_score
> summary(movies$audience_score)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  11.00   46.00   65.00   62.36   80.00   97.00 
> barplot(movies$audience_score)
> hist(movies$audience_score)
** Maybe look at negative correlations too
As you add more of X, you get less of Y
** things to lose, things of particular interest
- title
- title_type
- studio is probably not helpful, but we could tell our boss to watch
  movies from other studios (we work at Paramount)
- release year isn't helpful
- dvd release data might be useless, but... does it affect ratings?
  What if we compare theatrical release date to DVD release date?
- Does the number of iMDB votes matter?
- top200_box is interesting, as dollars matter
** Maybe divide the data into two sets
- Both audience and critics ratings good
- Both audience and critics ratings bad
(Maybe also use the top 200 thing).
Then use multiple linear regression to see what correlates to good and
bad films

** Perhaps correlating high scores to release month?
But isn't that putting the cart before the horse? Releasing a bad
movie in July or December might not make a difference.

** She wants to know what makes a movie "popular"
So we should go by audience scores and not critic's scores... but crit
scores do seem to be a predictor of audience scores.
** Time to DVD release

movies_cleaned_years <- movies_cleaned %>% filter(!is.na(dvd_rel_year)) %>% filter(!is.na(thtr_rel_year))

movies_cleaned_years <- movies_cleaned_years %>% mutate(days_to_dvd_release = as.Date(sprintf("%d-%d-%d", dvd_rel_year, dvd_rel_month, dvd_rel_day)) - as.Date(sprintf("%d-%d-%d", thtr_rel_year, thtr_rel_month, thtr_rel_day)))

does_dvd_matter <- lm(audience_score ~ as.numeric(days_to_dvd_release, units="days"), data = movies_cleaned_years)

summary(does_dvd_matter)
