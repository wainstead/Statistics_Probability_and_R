* Checklist
** Two main objectives
*** TODO She is interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular
*** TODO She is also interested in learning something new about movies
** Your project will consist of 6 parts:
*Make sure these points are addressed!*
As part of this project you will complete exploratory data analysis
(EDA), modeling, and prediction.

All template and rubric files that you will need to complete this
project can be found on the Project Files and Rubric page.
*** Data: (3 points)
**** TODO Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and
**** TODO the implications of this data collection method on the scope
of inference (generalizability / causality).
*** Research question: (3 points)
**** TODO Come up with a research question
that you want to answer using these data and a multiple linear
regression model.
**** TODO You should phrase your research question
in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset
allows for.
**** TODO You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones.
**** TODO Along with your research question include a brief discussion
(1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or
your audience.
*** EDA: (10 points)
**** TODO Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses
the research question you outlined above.
**** TODO Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations.
**** TODO Your EDA does not have to touch on every single variable that
you are considering for your model, but what you choose to present
should be a deliberate (not haphazard) selection. This might mean you
initially create a lot more visualizations and summary statistics than
what you finally choose to include in your paper.
**** TODO Each R output and plot should be accompanied
by a brief interpretation.
*** Modeling: (20 points)
**** TODO Develop a multiple linear regression model
to predict a numerical variable in the dataset.
**** TODO The response variable and the explanatory variables
can be existing variables in the dataset, or new variables you create
based on existing variables.
*** Prediction: (5 points)
**** TODO Pick a movie from 2016 (a new movie that is not in the sample)
and
***** TODO do a prediction for this movie using your the model
you developed and
***** TODO the `predict` function in R.
***** TODO Also quantify the uncertainty around this prediction
using an appropriate interval.
*** Conclusion: (3 points)
**** TODO A brief summary of your findings from the previous sections without
repeating your statements from earlier
**** TODO as well as a discussion of what you have learned about the data
and your research question.
**** TODO You should also discuss any shortcomings of your current study
(either due to data collection or methodology) and include ideas for
possible future research.

** In addition to these parts, there are also 6 points allocated to:
- format
- overall organization
- readability of your project

Total points add up to 50 points. See the assessment rubric on the
Project Files and Rubric page for more details on how your peers will
evaluate your work.
* Notes on the data
** We are given the release day, month, and year
Can we correlate to holiday weekends? That would require finding and
adding more data.
** I can see a few Y's here
- Oscar nominations (there are a few categories)
- critics_rating
- imdb_rating
- audience_rating
- audience_score

to name a few.
** TODO Maybe look at the distributions of the different ratings
How skewed are the different ratings systems?
*** audience_score
> summary(movies$audience_score)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  11.00   46.00   65.00   62.36   80.00   97.00 
> barplot(movies$audience_score)
> hist(movies$audience_score)
** Maybe look at negative correlations too
As you add more of X, you get less of Y
** things to lose, things of particular interest
- title
- title_type
- studio is probably not helpful, but we could tell our boss to watch
  movies from other studios (we work at Paramount)
- release year isn't helpful
- dvd release data might be useless, but... does it affect ratings?
  What if we compare theatrical release date to DVD release date?
- Does the number of iMDB votes matter?
- top200_box is interesting, as dollars matter
** Maybe divide the data into two sets
- Both audience and critics ratings good
- Both audience and critics ratings bad
(Maybe also use the top 200 thing).
Then use multiple linear regression to see what correlates to good and
bad films

** Perhaps correlating high scores to release month?
But isn't that putting the cart before the horse? Releasing a bad
movie in July or December might not make a difference.
