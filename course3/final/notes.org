* Two main objectives
** TODO She is interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular
** TODO She is also interested in learning something new about movies
Perhaps correlating high scores to release month? But isn't that
putting the cart before the horse? Releasing a bad movie in July or
December might not make a difference.
* We are given the release day, month, and year
Can we correlate to holiday weekends? That would require finding and
adding more data.
* I can see a few Y's here
- Oscar nominations (there are a few categories)
- critics_rating
- imdb_rating
- audience_rating
- audience_score

to name a few.
* Maybe look at the distributions of the different ratings
How skewed are the different ratings systems?
** audience_score
> summary(movies$audience_score)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  11.00   46.00   65.00   62.36   80.00   97.00 
> barplot(movies$audience_score)
> hist(movies$audience_score)
* Maybe look at negative correlations too
As you add more of X, you get less of Y
* things to lose, things of particular interest
- title
- title_type
- studio is probably not helpful, but we could tell our boss to watch
  movies from other studios (we work at Paramount)
- release year isn't helpful
- dvd release data might be useless, but... does it affect ratings?
  What if we compare theatrical release date to DVD release date?
- Does the number of iMDB votes matter?
- top200_box is interesting, as dollars matter
* Maybe divide the data into two sets
- Both audience and critics ratings good
- Both audience and critics ratings bad
(Maybe also use the top 200 thing).
Then use multiple linear regression to see what correlates to good and
bad films
