# Programming in R, statistics, and probability

The files in this repository are from the coursework for Duke
Univerisity's classes in R programming, statistics, and probability.

The complete work of the first three courses is here.

The best stuff are the final projects:

* ./course1/final
* ./course2/final
* ./course3/final

For any of these, you need the free IDE
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. Just double click on
the file **final.Rproj** and fun things should happen.
