* Instructions

Your project will consist of 4 parts:

** TODO Data: (3 points)
Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the
implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference
(generalizability / causality). Note that you might will need to look
into documentation on the GSS to answer this question. See
http://gss.norc.org/ as well as the "More information on the data"
section below.
** TODO Research question: (3 points)
Come up with a research question that you want to answer using these
data. You should phrase your research question in a way that matches
up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. You are
welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. Along with
your research question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as
to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.
** TODO EDA: (10 points)
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research
question you outlined above. Your EDA should contain numerical
summaries and visualizations. Each R output and plot should be
accompanied by a brief interpretation.
** TODO Inference: (28 points)
Perform inference that addresses the research question you outlined
above. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief
interpretation.

In addition to these parts, there are also 6 points allocated to format, overall organization, and readability of your project. Total points add up to 50 points. See the assessment rubric (provided above) for more details on how your peers will evaluate your work.

You can begin working on the project immediately. Please save your work as you go along. When you're ready to submit your work for evaluation, remember to click the "Submit" button.

After you submit your proposal, please provide feedback to others on their projects. Please assess at least 3 projects. This peer assessment will not only provide you with experience with a data set and research questions but also prepare for your projects in the future courses in the Specialization.
